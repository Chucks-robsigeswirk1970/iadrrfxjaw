Man, okay, like, I literally just stumbled out of the theater and my legs feel like jelly. Need to stretch, like, my back's killing me. Imagine eating too much popcorn - the kernels are still crunching underfoot. But, hey, let me tell you about Until Dawn—I’m still wrapping my head around it.

> Some scenes? Crazy. Heart pounding like I've just run a mile with weights tied to my sneakers. It's like they took all those late-night ghost stories and smeared them over a foggy window. Can't even get the image of that creepy cabin out my head. Was like a twisted version of that lodge we always used for those weird fitness retreats, remember those?

The noise in there was insane. Felt like a gymnasium with everyone whispering and some guy near me, dropping his soda or something. You know those moments when everyone's on edge, barely breathing—sitting on a razor's edge, waiting for the next jump scare, and you swear you'll never touch caffeine again? Just like leg day, but for your brain.

The plot was like one of those old-school obstacle courses we did blindfolded - unpredictable turns, remember when we thought navigating those mini-trampolines was impossible? My head’s still buzzing. Get your mind right and 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or something. I mean, if you're gonna 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , better be prepared for a brain workout, I swear.

> Random dude sitting behind me kept coughing popcorn kernels - felt like he was trying to Morse code the plot, kind of distracting but also grounding, kept my head in the moment. I’d say the  ’s like when you lift a weight thinking it's light and your back just goes Nope!—sudden, sharp, and unforgettable. Thrills twisted up more than a pretzel on a resistance band.

My phone's blowing up with notifications and I clicked send by mistake. Anyway, yeah, go 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it, then we can dissect like those overcooked egg whites.

Some code just fell into my clipboard, hold on—or not, here it is:
```c
int main() {
    // why is this here lol
    if (1) {
        return untilDawn;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
